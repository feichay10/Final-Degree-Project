This project presents the design and simulation of a network infrastructure, aimed at improving 
connectivity and centralised management of a multi-site organisation. This study proposes a modern, 
scalable and secure network architecture; designed according to the current needs 
of communication and technological management in distributed environments.

Simulation tools have been used to validate the performance of the design, including the implementation
of routing protocols or internal network services. The result has been a scalable and adaptable 
solution, aligned with the technical and operational requirements of a modern corporate network.
