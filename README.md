# Final Degree Project in Computer Engineering: Design of network infrastructure for a multi-site company

> **Written by: Cheuk Kelly Ng Pante**

## Description:
This project presents the design and simulation of a network infrastructure, aimed at improving 
connectivity and centralised management of a multi-site organisation. This study proposes a modern, scalable and secure network architecture; designed according to the current needs 
of communication and technological management in distributed environments.

Simulation tools have been used to validate the performance of the design, including the implementation of routing protocols or internal network services. The result has been a scalable and adaptable solution, aligned with the technical and operational requirements of a modern corporate network.

## Contents
In this repository you will find the report made on LaTeX, the configuration files for the network devices, and the simulation files used in the project.
